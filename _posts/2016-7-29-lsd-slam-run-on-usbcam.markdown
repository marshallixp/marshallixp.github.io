some words before...

 **semantics are necessary to build bigger and better SLAM systems.**  
 **Robotics is the killer application of SLAM**  
 **Will end-to-end learning soon replace the mostly manual labor involved in building todayâ€™s SLAM systems?. **  
 ->  Integrating semantics into SLAM is often talk about, but it is easier said than done. Moreno's PhD thesis: Dense Semantic SLAM

 **SLAM (construction) <---help---> Deep Learning (perception)**
 large-scale "correspondence engines" -> large-scale datasets
